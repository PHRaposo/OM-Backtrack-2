####OM-Backtrack is an adaptation of the backtrack part of SCREAMER
####to the paradigm of visual programming language of Openmusic.

####SCREAMER is an extension of Common Lisp that adds support for nondeterministic
####programming. Screamer consists of two levels. The basic nondeterministic level
####adds support for backtracking and undoable side effects. On top of this
####nondeterministic substrate, Screamer provides a comprehensive constraint
####programming language in which one can formulate and solve mixed systems of
####numeric and symbolic constraints. Together, these two levels augment Common
####Lisp with practically all of the functionality of both Prolog and constraint
####logic programming languages such as CHiP and CLP(R). Furthermore, Screamer is
####fully integrated with Common Lisp. Screamer programs can coexist and
####interoperate with other extensions to as CLIM and Iterate.
